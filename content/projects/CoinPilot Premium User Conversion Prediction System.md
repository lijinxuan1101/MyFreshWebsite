## Executive Summary

The CoinPilot Premium User Conversion Prediction System is a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to predict user conversion to premium services in a fintech application. The system leverages ensemble learning techniques to analyze user behavior patterns, financial profiles, and engagement metrics to provide accurate conversion probability predictions. The project encompasses data analysis, model development, and deployment through a modern web-based architecture using FastAPI and Streamlit.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed a high-performance Stacking Classifier achieving 69.7% accuracy
- Created a scalable microservices architecture with RESTful API
- Implemented user-friendly web interface with offline capability
- Analyzed 100,000 user records across 6 Southeast Asian countries

## Methodology

### 1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Size**: 100,000 user records with 20 features
- **Target Variable**: Binary conversion indicator (converted_premium: 0/1)
- **Geographic Coverage**: 6 countries (SG, MY, TH, PH, VN, ID)
- **Overall Conversion Rate**: 64.6%

**Feature Engineering:**
- **Demographic Features**: Age, tenure_months, income_monthly, savings_rate, risk_score
- **Behavioral Features**: app_opens_7d, sessions_7d, avg_session_min, alerts_opt_in, auto_invest
- **Portfolio Features**: equity_pct, bond_pct, cash_pct, crypto_pct
- **Geographic Features**: Country one-hot encoding (6 categories)

**Data Preprocessing:**
- StandardScaler normalization for continuous features
- OneHotEncoder for categorical country features
- Train-test split (80:20) with stratified sampling
- Cross-validation (5-fold) for robust model evaluation

### 2. Model Development Strategy

**Ensemble Learning Approach:**
The methodology employed a systematic comparison of ensemble learning algorithms:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Base estimator: Decision trees with bootstrap sampling
   - Out-of-bag scoring for unbiased performance estimation
   - Feature importance analysis for interpretability

2. **AdaBoost Classifier**
   - Base estimator: Shallow decision trees (max_depth=1)
   - Adaptive boosting with learning rate optimization
   - Sequential learning from misclassified instances

3. **XGBoost Classifier**
   - Gradient boosting with advanced regularization
   - Built-in feature importance calculation
   - Optimized for speed and memory efficiency

4. **Stacking Classifier (Final Model)**
   - Base models: XGBoost + AdaBoost (complementary strengths)
   - Meta-learner: Logistic Regression
   - Cross-validation stacking to prevent overfitting

**Model Selection Rationale:**
- XGBoost: Best accuracy (69.8%) and precision (72.8%)
- AdaBoost: Best recall (90.5%) for capturing conversions
- Stacking: Combines complementary strengths for optimal performance

### 3. Evaluation Framework

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision**: True positive rate among predicted positives
- **Recall**: True positive rate among actual positives
- **ROC AUC**: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV for robust performance estimation

**Feature Importance Analysis:**
- Permutation importance for model interpretability
- Top 10 features identification for business insights
- Feature correlation analysis for multicollinearity detection
