# An Analysis of Sustainable Strategies for Property Insurance
# Introduction
In this paper, I developed an LSTM model with an accuracy of 85% to predict future natural disasters using natural disaster data in Florida and California of the past 30 years. Applied neural network, linear regression, and deep learning models to assess the relationship between natural disasters and property damage.

# Summary

In recent years, homeowners and insurance companies have faced significant crises, necessitating the development of comprehensive solutions to meet the needs of all stakeholders involved in the insurance industry. This paper presents an innovative approach to property insurance by introducing an insurance company's property allocation model based on **deep learning** and **LSTM** and a market investment model utilizing **regression analysis**, as well as a community conservation building model employing **grey correlation analysis**. These models provide valuable insights and correlation analyses for the property-casualty insurance sector, promoting a more sustainable industry.

### Task 1: Natural Disaster Prediction and Property Damage Assessment Model

We conducted a comprehensive time series analysis of natural disasters and related data over the past 30 years in Florida and California. Subsequently, we developed an **LSTM** model to forecast future natural disasters. We then utilized neural network, linear regression, and **deep learning** models to assess the relationship between natural disasters and property damage, ultimately selecting the most effective **deep learning** model as the prediction model. Our next step involved predicting future disasters in California and Florida using the **LSTM** model, and leveraging the outcomes to further anticipate potential property damage through the deep learning model. Finally, by integrating the prediction results with the **time value** calculation of insurance theory, we formulated a suitable index system to aid insurance companies in determining underwriting decisions.

### Task 2: Real Estate Investment Decision Support Model

This task focuses on establishing a real estate investment model to support decision-making in construction and development. Through comprehensive **regression analysis**, including **linear regression**, **ridge regression**, and **Lasso regression**, we considered factors such as population density, income levels, employment opportunities, and willingness to purchase data to calculate housing market demand. Additionally, we predicted the impact of extreme weather events and property losses. By integrating income, willingness to purchase, and disaster-related losses, we accurately calculated the minimum investment cost. The model was successfully applied in Nanjing, China, providing accurate predictions and informing investment decisions.

### Task 3: Community Insurance Challenge Assessment Model

To empower community leaders in addressing insurance-related challenges, we designed a **grey correlation analysis model**. This model assisted in evaluating cultural, historical, economic, and other factors. By analyzing the problem's context, delineating data characteristics, and outlining the implementation environment, we applied the **grey correlation analysis model**, which yielded precise results.

### Task 4: Multi-Site Model Validation and Conservation Strategy Development

We scrutinized the models established in Task 2 and 3 across five sites in Nanjing, incorporating indicators such as resident population and GDP per capita. Through this analysis, we determined conservation priorities. Based on the outcomes of the model, we submitted an explanatory report to the community, detailing conservation priorities and strategies.
